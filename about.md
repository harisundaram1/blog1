# The Crowd Dynamics Lab blog

## Overview
The goal for the CDL blog is to communicate in an accessible manner to the public, new perspectives, and discoveries at the Crowd Dynamics Lab. 

Spending less time stuck in traffic, living in cities with little pollution, or leading healthy lives are outcomes that most of us would like. Achieving these outcomes, requires that people cooperate. How do we align what we want for society as a whole, with what individuals want?

Our goal at the lab is to empower individuals to take better decisions to harmonize individual goals with societal goals. We develop algorithms for empirical analysis of behavior (what can we measure? how well?), build systems (how to intervene?) and develop theory (how much could we possibly change?).

<!-- , we draw on ideas from  

and to shape behavior at scale. For example, if the city of Chicago wants to reduce traffic congestion, what should it do persuade people to try public transportation options, instead of driving their car? Designing incentives and messaging to harmonize individual goals (often to reduce travel time) with the City's objective is not easy. Public health is another example. If more people tended to their health through eating healthy food, and through exercise, not only would they individually benefit, but an improvement in public health would drive down  health costs for all. But despite interest in improving our health, we don't take the best decisions

Thus much of our work focus on empirical work (what can we measure? how well?), and building systems (how to intervene?) and theory (how much could we possibly change?).  -->

At the blog, you'll find posts by PhD students and by [Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu), the faculty leading the lab.
