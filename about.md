# The Crowd Dynamics Lab blog

## Overview
The goal for the CDL blog is to communicate in an accessible manner to the public, new perspectives, and discoveries at the Crowd Dynamics Lab.  At the blog, you'll find posts on understanding human behavior and empowering better decision making, viewed through the lenses of machine learning and human computer interaction. You will see posts every so often by PhD students and by [Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu), the faculty leading the lab. 

## Acknowledgements

We based our blog design on the [Jekyll Theme Pixyll](https://github.com/johno/pixyll) and updated the design inspired by the clean look of the [BAIR blog.](http://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/)
