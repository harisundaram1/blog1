A first post to see the utility of jekyll for creating blog posts for the group. Need to play with equations, inserted images, splash page image. Assume that $$x=y$$.

{% include image.html
            img="images/logo.jpeg"
            title="CDL Logo"
            caption="**Figure:** CDL logo; $$x \neq y$$? Markdown syntax and math in the captionâ€”yay!" %}
