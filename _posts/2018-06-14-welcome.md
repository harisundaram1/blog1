Spending less time stuck in traffic, living in cities with little or no pollution, or leading healthy lives are outcomes that most of us would like. Achieving these outcomes, requires that people cooperate on their actions. For example, If everyone decides to use the same major expressway at the same time to get to work, they would experience congestion, the opposite of their individual goal. Similarly, if few people use public transportation, and if most people decide not to take a flus shot, there would be more pollution and more unhealthy people.

How do we align what we want for society as a whole, with what individuals actually do? Employing tolls, is one strategy to decongest roads; but tolls (or taxes in general) are not possible in a variety of situations (e.g. should we tax someone who doesn't take the flu shot?). A different strategy is to understand why people take the decisions that they do, and enable them to take the decisions that benefits them individually as well as society as a whole. 

Our goal at the lab is to empower individuals to take better decisions to harmonize individual actions with societal goals. We develop algorithms for empirical analysis of behavior (what can we infer? how well?), build systems (how to empower better decisions?) and develop theory (how much could we possibly change? why do we observe the behaviors that we do?).
