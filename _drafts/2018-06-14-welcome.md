Spending less time stuck in traffic, living in cities with little or no pollution, or leading healthy lives are outcomes that most of us would like. Achieving these outcomes, requires that people cooperate on their actions. For example, If everyone decides to use the same major expressway at the same time to get to work, they would experience congestion, the opposite of their individual goal. Similarly, if fewer people paid attention to the food that they ate and didn't exercise, we would see more unhealthy people in the long run, increasing health costs for all.

>How do we reconcile an individual's desire for agency and choice in what they do, with what everyone wants for society as a whole?

Employing tolls, is one strategy to decongest roads; but tolls (or taxes in general) are not possible in a variety of situations (e.g. should we tax someone who doesn't take the flu shot, or someone who doesn't exercise?). A particular issue with health is that since we don't see any immediate feedback on our actions (what we eat; not to exercise), we tend to discount future outcomes.

<!-- A different strategy is to understand why people take the decisions that they do, where they take them (e.g. at the grocery store; on their smartphone while walking down the street) and then provide choices to enable them to take the decisions that benefits them individually as well as society as a whole. -->

Our goal at the Crowd Dynamics Lab is to empower individuals to take better decisions to benefit them, and to benefit society in the long run. We would like to do so at large scale (e.g. at the level of a city). Scale increases complexity since we have to understand the behavior of many people, but on the other, scale simplifies the challenge of meeting goals at the level of the city while ensuring that everyone takes decisions that is best for them. We can tackle the problem of scale today since a significant number of people have on them a powerful computer in their pocket—their smartphone.

 We develop algorithms for empirical analysis of behavior at scale (what can we infer? how well?), build systems (how to empower better decisions? provide choices in real-time where a person makes decisions—at the grocery store; on the smartphone while walking down the street) and develop theory (how much benefit could a particular framework provide? why do we observe the behaviors that we do?).
